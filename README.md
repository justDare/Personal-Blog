# Personal Blog Built with DJango and Vanilla JS

This is my personal blog of all things tech.

The web application is deployed via Heroku and can be accessed here: https://www.daretoprogram.ca/

## Features

### User Authentication

Users scan sign up for a profile in order to like and comment on post shared by writers. Writers are users granted staff status in the admin panel.

### AWS S3 Integration

Media content from posts are pulled in from AWS buckets and used with text content from a Postgress DB in Heroku in order to make up the posts.

### WISIWYG Text Editing

All posts can be edited in the backend admin panel within the browser. Users recieve email notifications when a new post is created.
